## Description :triangular_ruler:

The AirBnB project at Holberton School's console is the initial component that will jointly cover the basic ideas of higher level programming. The 'AirBnB project' aims to eventually deploy a straightforward replica of the 'AirBnB Website(HBnB)' on our server. In this phase, a command interpreter is built to manage objects for the "AirBnB(HBnB) website."

This is the first stage in creating our AirBnB clone, which will be our first complete web application.

An object management command translator for our Airbnb clone:

- Create a new object, such as a new place or user.

- Retrieving an object from a database, file, etc.

- Perform operations on objects (e.g., count, calculate statistics).

- Change an object's attributes

- Destroy a thing
